<center><h2>The Northwestern Purity Test</h2></center>
<img src="shmave.png" alt="Sherman Ave Logo">
<h2>The Rice Purity Test has historically served as a segue from O-week to true college life at Rice. Well I for one think it's fair to say that Rice University has fallen off. Where is it? Is it even a top 10 university? And what the fuck is O-week? It's high time someone released a Northwestern purity test, a good way to track your progress from Wildcat Welcome, to inevitable death sometime within the next four years.

<!-- This tells the scorer that it should expect an "end" tag -->
<input type=hidden name=start>
<!-- This is the base in which question numbers are given -->
<input type=hidden name=base value=10>
<!-- The debug parameter causes the scorer to report any errors it
encounters back to the test submittor.  This ensures that if there are
any problems with your test, you will see them when you test it out.
If you remove it, only fatal errors will be reported.
To get a more detailed report about your test, change the parameter name from
debug to verify and then submit an instance of your test with all of the
checkboxes selected.
This will give a report regardless of whether there are problems or not, so
after fixing any problems that show up, remove the verify parameter. -->
<input type=hidden name=debug>
<!-- Be sure to change NumQuest if you change the number of questions! -->
<input type=hidden name=NumQuest value=100>
<input type=hidden name=Name value=Northwestern>
<!-- Make sure that if you add/remove questions or change the point values of
any questions, you change maxscore so that it remains the sum of all of the
question values! -->

<!-- Insert a scoring guide entry into the value field of each of the Map
lines below.  Change the 0 that precedes the colon to the maximum-score for
the category, and add the category's description immediately after the colon.
Here is how the scoring guide works:
A test submittor will be put in a given category if they get any score from
that category's maximum score down to (but not including) the next lowest
category's maximum score.  That means that one of the categories must have a
maximum score exactly equal to the maximum score possible for your test.  The
category with the lowest maximum score will be assigned to submittors who get
any score from its maximum score down through zero.
Remember, scores are calculated as the number of purity points *retained*, so
the category that has a maximum score equal to your test's maximum score should
have a category name appropriate for someone who has retained all or nearly all
of their purity in your test's domain (that is, they answered yes to few
questions or none at all).
The order that the categories are given in here is not important. -->
<ol>
<!-- Append a question to each checkbox line below.
For each question line, the value gives the question number, then a comma,
then the point value.
If you want any question to have a point value other than one, change it.
Point values must be positive integers.
If you don't use all of the checkbox lines, delete the unused ones.
If you need more, add them, incrementing the question number of each line.
If you make any such changes, remember to adjust the NumQuest and maxscore
values as described above! -->
